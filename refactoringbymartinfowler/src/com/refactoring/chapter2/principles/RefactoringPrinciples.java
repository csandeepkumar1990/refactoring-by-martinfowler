/**
 * Chapter 2: Principles in Refactoring
 * 
 * This chapter covers the fundamental principles of refactoring:
 * 
 * 1. DEFINITION: Refactoring is the process of changing a software system
 *    in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code
 *    yet improves its internal structure.
 * 
 * 2. WHY REFACTOR?
 *    - Improves the design of software
 *    - Makes software easier to understand
 *    - Helps find bugs
 *    - Helps you program faster
 * 
 * 3. WHEN TO REFACTOR?
 *    - The Rule of Three: Refactor when you do something for the third time
 *    - When adding a feature
 *    - When fixing a bug
 *    - During code review
 * 
 * 4. WHAT TO TELL YOUR MANAGER?
 *    - Refactoring speeds up development
 *    - It reduces bugs
 *    - It makes code easier to understand
 *    - It's part of good programming practice
 * 
 * 5. PROBLEMS WITH REFACTORING:
 *    - Database refactoring is harder
 *    - Changing published interfaces
 *    - When you don't have tests
 * 
 * 6. REFACTORING AND DESIGN:
 *    - Refactoring complements design
 *    - You can do less upfront design
 *    - Design emerges through refactoring
 * 
 * 7. REFACTORING AND PERFORMANCE:
 *    - Don't optimize prematurely
 *    - Refactor first, then optimize
 *    - Most performance problems come from a small part of the code
